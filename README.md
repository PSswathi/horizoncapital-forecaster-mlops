# horizoncapital-forecaster-mlops
Build and deploy an AWS SageMaker MLOps pipeline that forecasts bank capital-planning risk metrics 6–24 months ahead using integrated macroeconomic (FRED), demographic (Census), and financial time-series data, with backtesting and interpretable driver insights.

## PROJECT STATUS -  In Progress

### Project Background:

Banks must allocate capital efficiently across portfolios while meeting regulatory requirements
and maintaining adequate liquidity buffers. Inaccurate long-term forecasts can result in
over-capitalization, which limits growth opportunities, or under-capitalization, which increases
regulatory, credit, and liquidity risk. As economic conditions evolve over time, banks require
1 forecasting approaches that can capture both cyclical macroeconomic changes and 
slower-moving structural trends.
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning–based forecasting system that
predicts key banking risk or capital-planning proxy metrics over long horizons (6–24 months).
The problem is formulated as a supervised, multivariate time-series forecasting task, where
historical economic, demographic, and financial indicators are used to generate forward-looking
forecasts that support improved capital allocation and planning decisions.
